Models and datasets for generative foreground modeling. 

# Datasets

There are two available datasets so far.

* Planck GNILC 545 GHz. The 545 GHz GNILC map is processed as described in [arXiv:2101.11181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11181). 
* MHD simulations: . 

# Models

## Encoder Models

* *Convolutional Autoencoder*: this model is described in the paper [arXiv:2101.11181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11181).
* *VAE with ResNet encoder*: this is a similar model using a ResNet model for the encoder.

## Decoder Models

## Normalizing Flows

* *IAF*: this is an implementation of the inverse autoregressive flow model described in [arXiv:1502/03509](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03509).
